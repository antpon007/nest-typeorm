## Description

For the development of this project, [hexagonal architecture](https://apiumhub.com/es/tech-blog-barcelona/arquitectura-hexagonal/) was implemented in order to strengthen greater knowledge on this topic and put the [SOLID](https://profile.es/blog/principios-solid-desarrollo-software-calidad/) principles into practice.

The database is hosted on an RDS in AWS, you will also find within the [utils/bd-scripts](https://github.com/antpon007/nest-typeorm/tree/main/utils/bd-scripts) folder the script to import it locally if you wish, taking into account making the change in the configuration file of the database module.

To make use of the postman collection, you need to look for it in the folder [utils]

## Bank of Dreams

At the end of the development of this API, the following characteristics are available:

1. Login.
2. List of my bank accounts.
3. List of transactions associated with a specific account.
4. Transaction detail
